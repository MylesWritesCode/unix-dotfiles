# Overview
`settings.json` includes my settings for Windows Terminal. I know it's not
pertinent to 'regular' dotfiles that come with Linux, but it's part of my
workflow, so I'm sticking it here.

## To use
```
  # Open `settings.json` in some text editor, preferebly VSCode
  $ code ./settings.json
  
  # Copy contents of the file, then,
  # 1. Open Windows Terminal
  # 2. Open settings (Ctrl + ,)
  # 3. Click on Actions -> Open JSON file
  # 4. Copy config from `settings.json` into the opened file
  # 5. Save and enjoy
```

# Changelog
**28 Sept 2021**
- Added files and instructions on how to move config to a new box.
