# Overview
Complete VSCode settings.json from ChrisAtMachine, kept here to use
as an example for my own settings. I'm pretty sure I covered the important
settings in README.md. This is here just in case something doesn't work.

# Changelog
**28 Sept 2021**
- Moved all VSCode settings to it's own folder in `.config`. It's not necessary
for Linux, but is useful to keep on hand for my Windows config.

**12 Sept 2021**
- Moved `settings.json` from ChrisAtMachine -> `settings.backup.json`. I think I've found a setting config that I like, but I want to make sure I can see what other options I have available.
- Added **psioniq File Header** to `settings.json`. I'm probably going to be using this all the time anyway, unless VSCode adds their own implementation of header inserts.
